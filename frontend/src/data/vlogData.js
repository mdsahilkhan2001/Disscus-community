            <p class="mb-4">The new campus library isn't just a place to store books; it's a statement about the future of sustainable learning environments. As I walked through the glass atrium, the first thing that struck me was the abundance of natural light.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">I had the chance to interview the lead architect, who explained that the building is designed to reduce energy consumption by 40%. The materials used are locally sourced, and the roof features a rainwater harvesting system that maintains the surrounding gardens.</p>
            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">Sustainable Design Features</h3>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mb-4 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>Solar Paneling:</strong> Covering 60% of the roof surface.</li>
                <li><strong>Smart Climate Control:</strong> Sensors adjust airflow based on occupancy.</li>
                <li><strong>Recycled Insulation:</strong> Acoustic panels made from post-consumer denim.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="mb-4">For students, this means more than just a pretty building. The study pods are soundproofed with recycled materials, and the air quality is monitored by smart sensors to ensure optimal concentration levels.</p>
            <p>It's truly a space that inspires creativity and collaboration. I highly recommend visiting the 4th-floor terrace during sunset!</p>

            <p class="mb-4">Ever wondered what it actually takes to survive the CS major? It's not just staring at Matrix code screens (though there is some of that). Here is my typical Tuesday:</p>
            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">Morning: The Caffeine Phase</h3>
            <p class="mb-4"><strong>08:00 AM:</strong> The alarm goes off. It's time for "Advanced Data Structures". Coffee is non-negotiable at this hour. We're diving into Red-Black trees today, and I need full brain power.</p>
            <p class="mb-4"><strong>11:00 AM:</strong> Quick break between classes. I usually head to the student center to catch up on assignments or debug code from the night before.</p>
            
            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">Afternoon: The Grind</h3>
            <p class="mb-4"><strong>12:00 PM:</strong> Lunch with the capstone team. We're working on a machine learning project for traffic analysis. The debate over using PyTorch vs TensorFlow continues.</p>
            <p class="mb-4"><strong>04:00 PM:</strong> Lab hours. This is where the magic (and frustration) happens. Debugging a segmentation fault for two hours teaches you patience you didn't know you had.</p>
            
            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">Evening: Decompression</h3>
            <p><strong>10:00 PM:</strong> Winding down with some gaming with roommates. It's a hectic life, but building the future lines of code is worth every bug fix.</p>

            <p class="mb-4">The energy was electric! This year's Cultural Festival brought together over 5,000 students, faculty, and visitors for a weekend of celebration.</p>
            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">The Food Court</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">The International Food Court was a massive hit, serving everything from spicy Tteokbokki to authentic Gelato. The aroma alone was worth the visit. The 'Taste of India' stall had a line stretching back to the quad!</p>
            
            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">Performances</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">On the main stage, the Battle of the Bands saw the Engineering faculty take home the trophy with their surprise jazz-fusion set. Who knew engineers had so much soul?</p>
            <p class="mb-4">The traditional dance showcase featured performances representing 15 different countries, highlighting the incredible diversity of our student body.</p>
            
            <p>We're already planning for 2025, and it's going to be even bigger. Stay tuned for volunteer sign-ups next month!</p>

            <p class="mb-4">"We've been working on the pathfinding algorithm for six months," said Sarah, the team lead. "To see it perform perfectly under pressure validates all those sleepless nights."</p>
            <p class="mb-4">The robot features a custom-built chassis using lightweight carbon fiber and is powered by a Jetson Nano for real-time vision processing.</p>
            <p>Next stop: The International Robotics Summit in Tokyo next Spring. The team is currently fundraising for the trip.</p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">1. The Rooftop Garden (Science Block)</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">Accessible via the West elevator. It has great Wi-Fi, fresh air, and a view of the city. Perfect for creative writing or reading assignments.</p>
            
            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">2. The Old Archive Room</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">Tucked away in the History department basement, this room smells like old paper and silence. Strictly no phones allowed, making it ideal for deep focus work.</p>
            
            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">3. The "Blue" Lounge</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">Located in the Arts building. Comfy bean bags and vending machines nearby. A nap trap if you're not careful!</p>

            <p class="mb-4">Artificial Intelligence is not here to replace teachers, but to augment them. Imagine a personal tutor that adapts to your specific learning style in real-time.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">We are seeing early implementations where AI helps students visualize complex physics problems or practice language conversation without fear of judgment. This democratization of personalized attention could close the achievement gap.</p>
            
            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">Ethical Considerations</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">However, we must also address the ethical implications. Data privacy, algorithmic bias, and the loss of human connection are valid concerns that need rigorous debate.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">The university is launching a new "AI Ethics" elective next semester to explore these very topics.</p>
            
            <p>The future is exciting, but we must navigate it with caution and empathy.</p>
